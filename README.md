# Our project:
Our project is a party drink website that helps with party planning for students and adults. Our website gives you the recipes for different types of alcoholic drinks. If you are not sure on any names for drinks, we give you a list of suggestions or you can type any letter in the search tab and it we will give you all the recipes that we have with that letter.  In case you want to create your own drink, we have a "New Recipe page" where you can do that. Finally if you want to learn more about us and what we do we have a page called "About". 

# Repo Organization:
Our repository is organized into some folders and subfolers on Github. We chose Github because we had worked with it during our labs and found it very useful in constructing a repository where everyone could share, edit, and upload files. Every folder we created holded a sum of files that went together, named effectively so that any files could be found quickly. All of our code for the project in found in the TipseyTeammate folder. Some of the back end of our porejct can be found in the drink_database and init_data folders and some of the front end can be found in the views folder.

# Building, Running, and Testing Code
All of our building code happened in visual studios and Sublime text. Testing and running the code took place in Docker and the terminal. The terminal is always the most useful application to run and test code. This was true for all of the aspects of our project like the html, node.js and the database.
